                <h2>CS50 - Web developer</h2>
                <p>I am a hardworking, open and team-oriented individual who wants to engage in the business management process on the international arena in order for my work to have a real impact on the world. Therefore, I want to understand the various mechanisms and sectors of the international business – the unique structure of the IBA program allows for this ideally. Having had experience with international study programmes, I am also aware of the many benefits which arise from studying in an international environment, such as the opportunity to be part of a multinational team and gain a new perspective on the world around me. In order to become a good manager and innovator, I need a deep understanding of society, its various aspects and differences. IBA will allow me to identify the needs of communities better and learn to cooperate with an international team to be able to create and launch with them effective innovations that will contribute to a positive change in the world.</p>
